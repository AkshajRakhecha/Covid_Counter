# covid_counter

I have developed an App using Flutter to track the active and â€œYear To Date" Covid cases in India.
The data is displayed as a dashboard in the App. 
My goal for the App was to target people who want to travel, so that they can assess the situation in a place before travelling.
Covid-19 has paused all our lives. 
While we will never really go back to normal, we need to make use of the tools we have to return to certain activities, safely. 
My app is meant to help make it easier for people to go back to a less restrictive lifestyle, without compromising safety. 
I have been unable to publish the App as Google play store does not allow any covid related app by an individual.
